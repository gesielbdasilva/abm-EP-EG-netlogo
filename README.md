Agent-based model to compare the truth-tracking features of two measures of explanatory reasoning: explanatory power, given by $`\mathcal{E}_{P}(e,h) = \log\left\lbrack \frac{P\left( e \middle| h \right)}{P(e)} \right\rbrack`$, and explanatory goodness, given by $`\mathcal{E}_{G}(e,h) = \mathcal{E}_{P}(e,h) - \frac{1}{2} \:I(h)`$ where $`I(h) = - \;\log P(h)`$ is the informational complexity of $`h`$. 

This model is part of a research project in philosophy of science which focuses on Bayesian characterizations of explanatory virtues. To read the most recent draft discussing its results, please, email me at [gesieldasilva@missouri.edu](mailto: gesieldasilva@missouri.edu).
